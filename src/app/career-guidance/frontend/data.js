It defines how elements should be displayed on screen, on paper, or in other media. CSS separates the design from the content, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the layout, colors, and fonts of web pages. It uses a system of selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. CSS supports responsive design through media queries, enabling the creation of layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.",
